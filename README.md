# Free Code Camp HTML Projects
### About
These are projects I have completed to obtain the Responsive Web Design Certification at Free Code Camp, which can be
found here [learn.freecodecamp.org](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/). My profile can be found here [www.freecodecamp.org/filipe-toulson](https://www.freecodecamp.org/filipe-toulson).

Each project involves implementing a website according to given requirements. Each website is checked to see if it meets
the requirements, using Free Code Camp's testing script, and then submitted.

The testing script is included in each of the code pens for each project. To use it, make sure the correct test suite 
is selected. Then click on the "Run Tests" button.
